TreeBuilder
============

TreeBuilder is a folder structure building application inspired by [Nettuts' Structurer](http://net.tutsplus.com/freebies/others/free-mac-utility-app-structurer/).

I built this as a fun project for learning AutoIt

## Usage ##

* Set a base directory to create folder in
* Use VIM (i,j,k,l) to navigate the folder structure
* Ctrl+N for new files, Ctrl+Shift+N for new folders
* Click build to create your structure

## What is not working ##

* The "Content Management" feature
